From June 30 to July 5, 2025, I served as **Instructor & Tutor** during a 16-hour **PsychoPy3 Programming and Open Science Summer School**, hosted by the **ARCA Initiative** and held at the Department of Statistical Sciences, **University of Padova**.

This Summer School was led by **Dr. Rebecca Hirst**, **Chief Science Officer at [Open Science Tools](https://opensciencetools.org/#mission)** and one of the core team members behind [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/about/index.html).

## Workshop Title

**"The ARCA Initiative: Unlocking Psychological Expertise for Academic and Business Success"**

---

## My Role

As **Tutor and Assistant Instructor**, I supported Dr. Hirst in:
- Delivering lectures and coding demonstrations
- Assisting students with troubleshooting their experiments
- Providing personalized feedback and mentoring on experimental design
- Promoting open science practices and reproducibility using GitHub and PsychoPy

---

## Workshop Focus

This workshop combined practical programming with theoretical discussions on **open science**, **experimental reproducibility**, and the **use of PsychoPy3** for behavioral task design. Participants learned to build experiments from scratch and implement best practices in transparent, replicable psychological research.

---

## Tools and Platforms Used

- **PsychoPy3 (Builder and Coder interfaces)**  
- **GitHub & GitHub Pages** for collaborative project hosting  
- **Markdown & YAML** for reproducibility workflows  
- **Open Science Framework (OSF)**
