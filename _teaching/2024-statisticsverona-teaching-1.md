From November 27, 2024, to January 8, 2025, I served as **Adjunct Professor** for a 20-hour online course titled *Basic Level Statistics*, part of the Doctoral School at the University of Verona.

The course introduced doctoral students to fundamental principles of measurement theory and statistical inference using R and Jamovi. Emphasis was placed on practical application, critical interpretation of statistical outputs, and transparent reporting following open science principles.
