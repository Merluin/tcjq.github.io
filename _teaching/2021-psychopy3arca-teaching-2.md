From 2021 to 2025, I regularly served as instructor for the **20-hour PsychoPy3 workshop** titled *Programmare un Esperimento*, part of the **Applied Research Courses Academy (ARCA)** at the Department of Developmental Psychology and Socialisation, University of Padova.  
I am also a **co-founder of ARCA** ([website](https://www.dpss.unipd.it/arca/home)).

## Workshop Description

This hands-on workshop teaches participants how to design and implement a full behavioral experiment using **PsychoPy3's Builder interface**. Starting from basic trial structures, we progressively cover advanced features such as dynamic stimulus control, feedback logic, and response logging. Each edition awards an **Open Badge** upon completion.
