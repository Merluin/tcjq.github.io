I am a French cognitive neuroscientist and registered clinical psychologist whose career bridges clinical practice, social work, and advanced neuroscience research. Before entering academia, I worked for several years in frontline social services with individuals facing severe mental health challenges, addiction, and social exclusion. Far from being a detour, this formative period grounded my scientific ambitions in real-world clinical needs and gave me first-hand insight into emotional regulation, resilience, and the complexity of human behavior—insight rarely found in researchers trained solely in academic settings.

Since transitioning into neuroscience research, I have built a distinctive profile at the intersection of sensorimotor neuroscience, social cognition, and neuromodulation, with a specialized focus on facial motor control and emotion recognition. My trajectory led me to Italy, where I completed both doctoral and postdoctoral training in a dynamic and internationally recognized research environment. These experiences were enriched by an academic placement in the United Kingdom and a visiting research period at the CNRS Lyon – Institut des Sciences Cognitives Marc Jeannerod, where I further deepened my expertise in comparative and translational neuroscience.

My work focuses especially on facial motor control, using innovative paradigms that combine tactile mechanoreceptor stimulation, TMS, EMG, and behavioral methods. These experiments are developed primarily using PsychoPy, for which I design custom components and interfaces to meet the needs of high-precision psychophysiological research. I am deeply committed to the values of open science: I actively share my tools, code, and datasets to foster transparency, replicability, and interdisciplinary collaboration.

This combination of applied clinical insight and technical expertise positions me to lead impactful, cross-disciplinary research projects such as the ORIS project, which aim to translate fundamental discoveries in neuroscience into concrete clinical and societal applications.
