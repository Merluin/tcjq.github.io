*Abstract*
Fearful body expressions convey critical information that is rapidly and preferentially processed, facilitating swift motor reactions to potential dangers. Consistent evidence has shown that even the subliminal presentation of fear-related expressions can impact visual processing and autonomic responses, increasing sensory vigilance for monitoring potential threats. However, it remains unclear whether the presentation of non-visible emotional bodies modulates corticospinal excitability (CSE) in the observer. To investigate this, we asked 22 healthy participants to perform a sex discrimination task involving neutral target body postures, preceded by the brief subliminal presentation of fearful, happy, or neutral body postures. CSE was tested using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) at early time points (70, 90, and 110 ms) after target stimulus onset. Results showed a significant CSE reduction in the dominant hemisphere for subliminal fearful primes compared to happy and neutral primes. This CSE suppression was independent of the time of stimulation, participants’ subjective or objective awareness, metacognitive sensitivity, or personality traits. Our findings highlight an early automatic activation of the motor system in response to subliminal fearful stimuli, supporting the view that fearful expressions, even when not consciously perceived, activate basic survival mechanisms for monitoring and preparing fast motor responses to potential threats.
